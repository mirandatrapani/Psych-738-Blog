<h1>Medin, D. L. (1989). Concepts and conceptual structure. <i>American psychologist,</i> 44(12), 1469.</h1>

<p>First thoughts: Concepts again! This module I think would have been very meaningful to have before embodied cognition, actually. Learning in depth these traditional ideas that embodied cognition challenges and works off of would have given me some context and perspective in some of the discussion and interpretations of the papers, I think. </p>

<p>Thoughts while reading: <ul>
<li> The classical view of concepts is centered on the idea that all examples of a category have some fundamental characteristics in common.</li>
<li> The issues with this classical view:<ul>
<li> Failure to specify defining features:these fundamental characteristics in common, what exactly are they? Some may say all violins are made of wood, but they are not.</li>
<li> Goodness of example effects: all examples of a concept are equally good because they all have the the necessary defining features, according to the classic view. However, this isn’t true in experience. People judge a robin as a better example of bird than ostrich, and can make category membership assessments (type-token? predication?) more quickly for “good” examples.</li>
<li> Unclear cases: for instances where it’s unclear (is a clock furniture? a rug?) people contradict each other and themselves later, according to the theory there shouldn’t be unclear cases</li></ul></li>
<li> The probabilistic view was developed in response, this view says that categories are fuzzy/ill-defined and there are instead highly correlated and lowly correlated features that they are organized around</li>
<li> According to the probabilistic view then how do things get assigned to a category? Some argue the family resemblance principle: they are compared to a prototype which is the perfect example of the category, I’m assuming?</li>
<li> Another way is the exemplar view. Essentially this view seeks to compare new stimuli to previous examples of the category in question to see if they’re similar.</li>
<li> These, while they have their pros and cons, over all focus on the same similarity principle, wherein category membership is determined by whether the candidate is sufficiently similar to whichever is used based on matches/mismatches of independent, equally abstract, features.</li>
<li> The meaning of similarity:<ul>
<lli> Similarity between 2 things increases as a function of the number of features or properties they share and decreases as a function of the number of mismatching features</li>
<li> These features are independent and additive</li>
<li> The features determining similarity are roughly the same level of abstract (or may be irreducible primitives)</li>
<li> These principles are sufficient to describe conceptual structure, and therefore, a concept is more or less equivalent to a list of its features</li></ul></li>
<li> To paraphrase: the features you look at cannot be reduced to even simpler features or components (I guess to account for things like color or height), they are additive in that you can say “x y z and features that are the same” which allows for the list</li>
<li> Issues with prototypes: By definition prototypes should be context independent but this has not been observed in studies</li>
<li> If the small spoon is more typical than large and metal more typical than wooden, a small wooden spoon or large metal should be more typical than large wooden but this is not the case at all. Alternatives such as that there are multiple spoon prototypes that are context dependent do not fit in this theory as it is pretty unfeasible that every adjective noun combination has its own prototype</li>
<li> Oh cool, Barsalou’s work prior to construction the embodied cognition theory is cited here! This person has worked with him!! How interesting</li>
<li> In general, it seems like work on categorization behavior has not shown patterns in line with the prototype model of concept creation. Namely there are issues of cases where people can make intuitive assumptions about groups that wouldn’t be possible with just a prototype to base off of, like that small birds tend to sing and large birds do not.</li>
<li> Most of these issues are with the position that features are independent and additive. The exemplar model seeks to improve on this, instead focusing on how classification relies on memory/retrieval being limited, similarity-based, and context sensitive. </li>
<li> The two biggest issues with exemplar model are these: why do we have the categories that we have? and do things that belong in the same category look similar because they are the same category? Or are they in the same category because they are similar? Essentially, the directionality of that causal relationship is unknown.</li>
<li> “Once one concedes that similarity is dynamic and depends on some (not well-understood) processing principles,” But a zebra and a barber pole are still the at the same level of similarity in pattern specifically whether that’s the only thing you are considering or if you are considering their overall similarity. If you asked “are these two similar?” the answer would be no, but I’m sure if probed the first thing people would say is “well they both have stripes” and this holds constant, the only difference in asking for similarly of patterning from the get go is you skipped straight to the probing.</li>
<li> “examples like robin and squirrel shared many important properties that almost
never show up in attribute listings (e.g., has a heart, breathes, sleeps, is an organism, is an object with boundaries, is a physical object, is a thing, can be thought about, and so on).” Well sure but these aren’t useful similarities because they are insanely broad and features found in every single living thing (or every single tangible object, the entire world surrounding) which means they are useless for categorization purposes</li>
<li> “The general point is that attempts to describe category structure in terms of similarity will prove useful only to the extent that one specifies which principles determine what is to count as a relevant property and which principles determine the importance of particular properties.” Oh I understand now, yes agreed!</li>
<li> From these issues with similarities the author argues that “Similarity may be a byproduct of conceptual coherence rather than a cause” and instead that “concepts are organized around theories, and theories provide conceptual coherence.”</li>
<li> “Our interpretation is that white and grey hair are linked by a theory (of aging) in a way that white and grey clouds are not.” Additionally, grey and black clouds are linked by the expectation of a thunderstorm from them! While white clouds would probably be associated with a sunny or partly cloudy day</li>
<li> “It is important to note that psychological essentialism refers not to how the world is but rather to how people approach the world.” Followed immediately after a paragraph explaining how people categorize others as male or female, amazing. This paper, completely unexpectedly, gets so close to identifying and explaining the exact fallacy of the idea of binary gender</li>
<li> So the theory that the author proposes is instead this theory that similarity is more reliant on theories (hah) And offers some evidence related to key aspects:<ul>
<li> Nonindependence of features: “the ease or naturalness of classification tasks cannot be predicted in terms of abstract category structures based on distribution of features, but rather requires an understanding of the knowledge brought to bear on them, for this knowledge determines inter-property relationships.” Specifically, the example above about the clouds and hair colors</li>
<li> Levels of features: When making similarity judgements across an arbitrary set of similar stimuli (childrens drawings of people in this case), the similarities shared across them always had a few levels of abstraction to them. “This underlines the point that categorization often involves more than a simple matching of properties.” There was also the point that a low level feature could be ambiguous because it could support multiple higher level associations/properties/interpretation</li>
<li> Centrality: Some properties are more “central” than others because of the role they play in conceptual structure, which appears to be dependent on the concept of which it is a part. Essentially, some features are more central/important to a thing’s category determination</li></ul></li>
<li> “The shift to a focus on knowledge-based categorization does not mean that the notion of similarity must be left behind” but instead that an updated approach is needed due to the fact that “explanations in organizing categories is much more compatible with features at varying levels linked by a variety of interproperty relations than it is with independent features at a single level” This is the bread and butter article interpretation</li></ul></p>

<p>Final thoughts: I definitely appreciated this article explaining so well the prototype and exemplar model of the probabilistic concept categorization view. I still feel at a loss for what this truly “classic” view of concepts is! I also am interested to hear more about how this theory responds to and works with embodied cognition, especially given that this author and Barsalou have worked together.</p>

<h1>”Murphy, G. L. (2016). Is there an exemplar theory of concepts?. <i>Psychonomic Bulletin & Review,</i> 23(4), 1035-1042.</h1>

<p>First thoughts: So in reading the beginning of this article this is clearly a very biased paper in favor of the prototype view. I’m curious whether and if so how the author will address the faults of the prototype view here, or if it will just cherry pick issues with the exemplar theory.</p>

<p>Thoughts while reading:<ul>
<li> “ignoring other important differences between the theories.” That’s not a very wise thing to do!</li>
<li> Already this paper is proving to be really biased, in its careful explanation of the range and framework of the prototype theory while simplifying the exemplar theory to “Exemplar models assume that this summary description is not needed, instead representing categories by memories of instances (exemplars) that are labeled with their category name” This ignores the use of feature-based models in the exemplar theory as well.</li>
<li> “However, Brooks did not say that you were likely to remember every dog you encountered or that every dog in memory would influence your classification.” I’m not so sure that’s what the exemplar theory says either</li>
<li> “Given all this, the evidence for exemplar effects seems quite strong and very consistent with other research in cognitive psychology.” This just feels like a focus on semantics, but I’m interested to understand this distinction, I hope the rest of the paper makes it clearer</li>
<li> “In the context of exemplar theory, however, it is not clear how to represent hierarchical structure itself.” In my understanding of the theory based on the previous paper, exemplar theory relied on these categories being “fuzzy” and members more befitting based on their features, with some more salient than others, in a context specific way. Unless this is exactly what is difficult to represent? But a context specific or fluid hierarchical system to me is not unclear, just more complicated. But cognition is complicated!</li>
<li> “Also, it is puzzling that each exemplar should be remembered this way, because when I see squirrels, it very seldom crosses my mind that they are mammals or animals, much less vertebrates.” Ah I see now. This article and the previous seek to account for this exact issue. Only the previous one offers up a new theory or perspective, and this one argues that the prototype comparison does not have this issue at all. </li>
<li> “All the ‘squirrels’ are not also encoded as ‘mammal,’ and so forth. So, on the basis of exemplars,
we would have to answer false to the question of whether all squirrels are mammals” Wait what? This is definitely not my interpretation of the exemplar theory. Category membership is certainly not mutually exclusive, it couldn’t possibly be! Certainly that would also be an issue that a prototype theory would also struggle from?</li>
<li> “(I will not address subordinate classification here.)” But isn’t that the hierarchy you’re seeking?</li>
<li> “Categorization is not performed by using the vague representation of mammals but instead by using exemplars encoded as mammals.” In my experience with cognition, it’s not been about your personal perception of your own cognition per se. To make the assumption that this “vague representation of mammals” is or is not the use of “exemplars encoded as mammals” would be making an assumption, I think, about the actual introspective or perceptual experience. However if you DID want to go down this route, I think that making the assertion which is necessary for the prototype theory to hold water, that the perceptual experience of accessing the prototype of dog for example, but always refer back to the exact same “dog” for a person, is inaccurate. I certainly don’t think of the exact same dog every time I think about “dog” personally I think about my experiences with dog, but I suppose that is entirely outside of this amodal theory altogether!</li>
<li> “Thus, it seems awkward that very close similarity of exemplars is required in order to explain categorization in learning experiments, but the dissimilarity of squirrels to cows is necessary to explain why squirrels are not easily classified as mammals. Cows should not affect how a squirrel is classified into any category, according to exemplar theory.” I’m not sure I follow this line of thought</li>
<li> “I might also believe that mammals evolved from dinosaur ancestors, but that is obviously also something not associated with individual exemplars.” Well no because mammals coexisted with dinosaurs and dinosaurs are a sub group of the living fauna of those time periods. From my understanding of dinosaurs, mammals did not evolve from dinosaurs. However nonetheless, this is not a case of categorization by the lay man who is not a paleontology expert. This is a case of simply learning a fact about dinosaurs or evolution. </li>
<li> “How is such knowledge represented in exemplar representations?” By whether the new candidate shares more features with exemplars of flightless birds than birds that can fly, thus making exemplars from flightless birds more salient? Not an attempt to be snarky, just how I would answer that question based on my understanding of this theory</li>
<li> “In hearing the question, exemplars representing the premise categories could be activated, and their similarity to exemplars of the conclusion category could be computed” To me, this answers our exact question above about birds and flight</li>
<li> “Why should a robin’s representativeness of the bird category, which was not mentioned in the question, affect its induction to penguins? Why is the similarity of a robin to a penguin not sufficient?” I think this is the strongest support for a prototype theory over an exemplary theory thus far.</li>
<li> The final paragraph refers to the semantic representation of words, and how important concepts are for this. I wonder if this author is purposefully ignoring the way that embodied cognition research has turned that assumption on its head, as well as how he reconciles the prototype theory with it.</li>
<li>I feel like on a continuum of similarity, exemplar theory sits closer to embodied cognition than does prototype theory, but I am struggling to put words to why I have that perception</li>
<li> “Such models can represent both ‘exemplar-like’ and ‘prototype-like’ effects, while not restricting themselves to one kind of representation. Perhaps such approaches can serve as the basis for a more encompassing theory of concepts.” While I do disagree with a lot of the conclusions this paper made, I think this here is an important takeaway for sure.</li></ul></p>

<p>Final thoughts: This paper felt very biased to me and the author also committed to interpreting the exemplar theory in a way beyond that which I personally have understood it to be from my own experience learning about it. Of course, my frame of reference is learning about both theories in a sort of equal “some people think this way, others that way” approach. What I would like to see is a closer comparison of the way these two theories seek to answer questions on the topics he described, as he did not focus much or at all on the way that the prototype theory accounts for some of these phenomena. Some of which I am not so sure that the prototype theory would do a good job with</p>

<h1>Gelman, S. A. (2004). Psychological essentialism in children. <i>Trends in cognitive sciences,</i> 8(9), 404-409.</h1>

<p>First thoughts: reading about this concept in the first paper was very interesting, and seeking to discover the ontogeny of these thoughts in children I think would be fun!  This paper’s abstract argues already that children are less concrete and have a tendency to search for “hidden, non-obvious” features, I wonder to what degree this is influenced by social expectations or social learning of what exactly these features are that they should be searching for?</p>

<p>Thoughts while reading: <ul>
<li> First of all in looking through this paper I see a few “blocks” which seem to have informative background information on the relevant concepts discussed here and I love that! The information is separated out and easily identified so you can get that background information if you need it or skip it if you’re familiar. I wish all papers had this kind of layout! All papers will also benefit from more images where appropriate too.</li>
<li> “Although there are serious problems with essentialism as a metaphysical doctrine, recent psychological studies converge to suggest that essentialism is a reasoning heuristic that is readily
available to both children and adults [3]. This article reviews such evidence, and discusses the implications for human concepts.” From the perspective of the observation that where people cannot yet use science to explain phenomena they turn to other explanations, this is a really interesting account of those other explanations and their other or perhaps original source!</li>
<li> “If essentialism requires knowledge of modern science and technology then it should emerge relatively late in development.” If it is the outgrowth of scientific knowledge according to Fodor, wouldn’t you expect children to rely on it even more? Their scientific knowledge is more limited, thus they more quickly have to turn to essentialism for an explanation than an adult. Perhaps I misunderstand what is meant by outgrowth</li>
<li> “Rather than suggesting that human concepts overlook perception or similarity, essentialism carries with it the assumption that a category has two distinct, although interrelated, levels: the level of observable reality and the level of explanation and cause.” This seems to be the central argument or stance of this paper!</li></ul></p>

<p>Final thoughts: So I didn’t take many notes on this paper, but I found it very interesting! An account of the way in which this “essence” influences the responses of children, and suggestions for integrating this perspective into cognition theory of concepts was a good and interesting perspective, and I am always excited to learn about theories at this inception stage. This paper was also a very easy read and easy to follow, so I had less to say about being confused!</p>

<h1>Spelke, E. S., & Kinzler, K. D. (2007). Core knowledge. <i>Developmental science,</i> 10(1), 89-96.</h1>

<p>This paper has been cited 1323 times according to Google Scholar so I am anticipating some very high impact ideas, that will be interesting! This seems to be focusing on social cognition and how we conceptual, maybe organize, our social relationships? A very different perspective or consideration to be sure.</p>

<p>Thoughts while reading:<ul>
<li> According to recent research these authors they are suggesting another theoretical explanation of the cognition system of humans, this time focusing on four key systems (and adding a fifth, soon!):<ul>
<li> The first is object representation, indicated to be universal because the aspects and behaviors of being able to distinguish objects from non objects and track objects but only up to four are found in even the most different of cultures they could find</li>
<li> The second is a representation of agents and actions across spatio-temporal principles. This one confused me a little bit in how it is different from the previous specifically because being able to track four objects sounds like it would use both systems so concurrently I’m not sure how to argue one is more one or the other. However observations of other phenomena like mirror neurons and the ability to be sensitive of what predators or competitors can and cannot see (within the context of non-human animals) do make sense and also show that this agent representation is a very old system </li>
<li> The third is a number system, accounting for being able to follow things such as “diverse entities encountered through multiple sensory modalities, including arrays of objects, sequences of sounds, and perceived or produced sequences of actions” as well as “number representations can be compared and combined by operations of addition and subtraction.” Which is the most interesting description of math I have ever heard. However critically, even if you haven’t been taught a lot of math and don’t have a word for three, you can still understand make decisions based on ratios and can do addition and subtraction on approximations on large values, and other value judgements beyond finite math questions.</li>
<li> The fourth is geometry of the environment, I’m assuming involving things like spatial awareness and cognitive mapping. Distance, angle, and sense of relations, although it should be noted aspects of the environment such as shape and color are not found in this system. In studies children and animals tend tore ly on surface geometry when disoriented rather than landmarks, although adults do use landmarks more frequently in a two-system approach. </li></ul></li>
<li> The point of this paper is a proposed fifth core system of identifying and reasoning about potential social partners and social group members, due to the high salience of social interactions in all human communities. This corroborates well with assumptions/observations that social animals tend to be more cognitively talented than non-social animals! Although if these systems are meant to be discrete, maybe not so much.</li>
<li>  This system seems to focus on distinguishing potential members of ones own social group particularly as depicted by studies on infants that prefer people visually similar (in race and gender) as the people they see every day as well as prefer interactions or offerings with people that speak their native language (the language they hear every day, again the familiar)</li>
<li> “A predisposition for dividing the social world into us vs. them may have evolved for the adaptive purpose of detecting safe and trustworthy social partners, but it can be misemployed in modern, interconnected and multicultural societies. It even may support the ravages of discord, violence and warfare among individuals, groups and nations. For example, we need not look far to discover linguistic differences leading to social conflicts and intolerance. In US history, the tongues of slaves who spoke no English were severed, Russian speakers were executed following the Alaskan purchase, and the speaking of German in public was forbidden during World War II (Shell, 2001). A look abroad provides innumerable examples of warfare waged across linguistic lines.” This is a long paragraph to copy but I feel it’s a very important point to highlight, the way that potential seeking of familiar and friendly has been morphed in a bad way to support bigotry, however that final example I would argue contextually isn’t the best as it paints germans in a more victimized light than they deserve, undermining the weight of the horrors committed during WW2, but that is a HUGE digression I will not get into further</li>
<li> “Thus, even the deepest-rooted biases are not set in stone. As warring groups in contemporary
societies gain ever-greater means for mutual destruction, studies of the conditions that fuel or moderate
the development of intergroup bias could be of great importance.” That’s a great take, I like that.</li></ul></p>

<p>Final thoughts: I ended up really liking this paper and really liking its take away, the importance of the malleability of social biases. This paper is a lesser known cognitive theory, I think, but I liked learning about. </p>
