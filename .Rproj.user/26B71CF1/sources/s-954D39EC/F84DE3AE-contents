<h1>Rescorla, R. A. (1988). Pavlovian conditioning: It's not what you think it is. American psychologist, 43(3), 151.</h1>

<p>First thoughts: Rescorla immediately makes me think of Rescorla and Wagner! I had to google those names to refamiliarize myself with why I thought of them, and of course it's the paradigm of how learning is done/associations are made in classical conditioning, the way a connection between conditioned and unconditioned stimuli lead to the response to the conditioned stimulus. However this article is called "It's Not What You Think It Is" so I am curious to learn more about what that means!</p>

<p>Thoughts while reading: <ul>
<li> "I will describe how it touches on and informs several related fields that are currently more in vogue." Something about calling other fields of psychology in "vogue" is so funny to me. It's so true fields tend to go through phases in research! It's so interesting, the way it mirrors phases of interest in so many other and more conventionally creative aspects of life (fashion, architecture, interior design, hair and makeup, etc)</li>
<li> Also I'm very interested so far, I think my previous education has also probably only taught these foundations of classic conditioning and usually we immediately move on to operant conditioning. So I'm interested to know that this method of conditioning has continued to expand beyond what I know!</li>
<li> "Theory of contiguity, psychological theory of learning which emphasizes that the only condition necessary for the association of stimuli and responses is that there be a close temporal relationship between them" - From britannica.com, just a reference for myself for when the paper references contiguity (as I always forget exactly what makes it different from continuity!)</li>
<li> "It turns out that in many conditioning situations learning is determined not by what these treatments share but rather by how they differ" - From this I can gather that these rats are experiencing both treatments. It would make sense of course that if the shock and tone have no temporal association (one does not immediately follow the other) the rat would never learn to predict one after the other! Although looking at the figure makes it make more sense; the shock is just happening much more frequently than the tone. That makes sense intuitively!</li>
<li> "They strongly suggest that simple contiguity of CS and US fails to capture the relation required to produce an association." I think this kind of ignores, however, that while the shock is always paired with the tone, the tone is not always paired with the shock. By which I mean, is it truly contiguous if many shocks occur without a tone? Especially since I believe the two need to occur with around 0.3 seconds, is what I've heard? Although that is in reference to operant conditioning/positive reinforcement in animal training I believe, and is one of the main reasons why a clicker is such an effective bridge. Still, a shock could be considered a positive punishment so I would imagine a similarly short time range is applicable here too. At what point are two events no longer considered contiguous? Or I guess this is actually the whole point and why it challenges the theory of contiguity! I think I've made assumptions about what contiguity means based on what I know/understand/infer (and which is also supported by this study) that are in fact assumptions that challenge the theory. This is why learning the history of theories can be so tricky!</li>
<li> "I favor an analogy between animals showing Pavlovian conditioning and scientists identifying the cause of a phenomenon" This makes me think of this comic I've seen of two dogs talking to each other and one says to the other something along the lines of "Check it out! Every time you drool, they write in their little notebook!"</li>
<li> For the RH experiment, essentially it is saying that because they were able to extinguish an association to RH specifically, it proves that the pigeons had a concept of RH as a singular entity to begin with. If the birds had equally pecked for RH regardless of whether RH or R/H was extinguished, that would show that they are not making the connection of the two because all along they were relying on "I see red! Red means food!" and/or "I see stripe, stripe means food!" Because they successfully showed discrimination between RH and R and H they show that their initial reaction to RH was based on the stimuli as a combined, new stimulus. I hope I'm understanding that right! </li>
<li> "to signal not another stimulus but rather a relation between two other stimuli" This is really interesting sounding and something I'm having trouble wrapping my head around conceptually, I'd love an example</li>
<li> Exploring the way that different conditioned stimuli are responded to when they are paired with the same unconditioned stimulus (in this example a shock to a rat) is really cool! It makes so much sense intuitively that a rat would respond to a tone differently than a probe. If I were a little rat maybe I would hope that hiding the probe would prevent the shock? But the tone I would probably feel powerfuless to and simply stand in fear waiting for the shock. Maybe it's anthropomorphizing to describe them as having anticipation or expectations or be attempting problem solving (however futile an attempted solution) from just this result, but at least recognizing the variability in responses that we do actually see is definitely important!</li>
<li> Ok so to summarize the reasons why "CS will produce the same response as US" is not always accurate in classical conditioning: <ul>
<li>Sometimes a response involves conditioned suppression. A shock response is a dramatic reduce in activity, but a response to a tone paired to a shock is a general increase in activity.</li>
<li>How a response is conditioned varies from CS to CS, and sometimes a change in activity is not necessarily seen until the CS is tested as a reinforcer</li>
<li> A CS can influence a different kind of behavior such as a choice between two behaviors that lead to two different rewards if the CS is paired with one of the rewards. From this the CS can influence behavior beyond the context of eliciting the response that was initially seen with the US</li></ul>
<li> "For instance, one of the learning principles most frequently adopted within these models, the so-called delta rule, is virtually identical to one popular theory in Pavlovian conditioning, the Rescorla-Wagner model." So cool, I want to look into the delta rule!</li>
<li> "Phenomena such as drug tolerance (e.g., Siegel, 1983), stress-induced analgesia, and immunosuppression (e.g., Ader & Cohen, 1981) seem to involve Pavlovian conditioning." Definitely it seems especially now that I know where the field had expanded at this time. Especially drug tolerance, as I was reminded of how tolerance is actually context-dependent while reading this paper. It's been shown that a certain amount of a drug can lead to an overdose in a novel context when that same person will have previously not overdosed when taking it in the person's familiar environment for drug use.</li></ul></p>

<p>Final thoughts: This was an awesome and eye opening paper! Also very easy to follow, I only got a little bit confused once or twice but was otherwise able to follow it really well. The examples were very clear and effective in ellucidating what the author was saying. Also, it's exciting to hear about the further advances in a study beyond what most have learned in their introductory courses.</p>

<h1>Pearce, J. M., & Bouton, M. E. (2001). Theories of associative learning in animals. Annual review of psychology, 52(1), 111-139.</h1>

<p>First thoughts: A more recent article that covers associative learning and judging by the plural theories in the title, as well as the abstract, this is a review of current literature! This piece will probably cover the 20 or so years of research that followed the previous one. </p>

<p>Thoughts while reading:<ul>
<li>"repeatedly presenting a CS by itself significantly retarded subsequent conditioning when the CS was paired with a US. That is, simple exposure to a stimulus was sufficient to reduce its associability" This makes sense intuitively. If any subject had previously experience a stimulus as not associated with another for a while, they expect to not see one with another. An expectation takes longer to change than having no expectation (like in novel experiences) regardless of whatever the expectation is.</li>
<li> "Once elements are in the A2 state they can move only into the inactive state, even if the stimulus to which they are related should be presented." This doesn'y really make sense to me. If A2 is like being at the margin of attention (Like the periphery of your eyesight) why can you not shift your attention and move the stimulus into A1? Surely we do that often?</li>
<li> Wagner theory wrt associability of a stimulus: "These findings are difficult to interpret, however, because we do not know if sufficient exposure to the context was given in order for the context-CS associations to be extinguished." I guess that would depend on how strong the association was, which would probably involve a similar formula to formula 1?</li>
<li> Wagner again: "Because the common element, X, is presented more often than the unique features, A and B, it follows that the associability of X will decline more rapidly than that of A and B. If the two compounds should be used for a discrimination after they have been preexposed, the relatively low associability of the common feature will ensure that the discrimination will be acquired more readily than when the compounds are novel and the associability of the common feature is high." I guess this means that it's easy to sort of ignore X and just focus on A and B which seem to be more important to the discrimination task.</li>
<li> Mackintosh theory wrt associability of a stimulus: "However, if the stimulus is a poor predictor
of reinforcement, its associability will be low." There is a lot of ways that other cognitive processes such as motivation and attention come into play here that I feel like are not quite being named! Maybe it's just because I'm unfamiliar with most of these papers that are only briefly mentioned when referencing their theory. Still, it would make sense that an animal would be much more highly motivated to get an award, and thus more likely/willingly/ in paying attention.</li>
<li> Mackintosh theory/in general: I wonder how often these calculations (asymptote for conditioning and where a stimulus' own associability falls on that graph) are actually done, because it seems to me like the determining the values for these would be difficult especially with so many potential confounds (like literally everything about an environment)</li>
<li> Mackintosh theory: "At present it is not clear how the findings described by Hall & Pearce (1979) can be reconciled with successful demonstrations of an ID-ED effect." I feel like the emotional salience of shocks (something they definitely dont like) vs. how neutral color and pattern are is important here. Also maybe something about how one is in regards to expectations (a CS predicting a shock) but the other is more about learning in that the subjects learn "this part of the stimulus is what to pay attention to." It's hard to describe but these are two different contexts and two different types of learning to me.</li>
<li> Pearce and Hall theory: "The associability of a stimulus will be high when it has been followed by a US that is unexpected (when (lambda)−VT is high), but its associability will be low when it has been followed by a US that is expected (when (lambda)−VT is low)." This is just for my reference although I think it kind of is saying what I was earlier about how expectations are probably important?</li>
<li> "The strength of the response will be determined by the similarity of P to P', PSP', multiplied by the associative strength of P, that is, PSP' x EP. The similarity of P and P' (which can vary between 0 and 1) is a function of the proportion of common elements they share. Formally, PSP' is given by the expression NC(squared)=(NP x NP')," Basically from these we can determine that P' cannot be as strong as P, but how strong it is at all is determined by how strong P initially was. That makes intuitive sense I think! I'm just not sure where N came from </li>
<li> Configural vs elemental associations: "or whether conditioned responding is a consequence of the influence of such configural associations in some circumstances and elemental associations in others" Personally this makes more sense to me, and the conditions that determine which types of associations are being made rely more on context, particularly what leads to more desired outcomes/what is the "correct" way to solve the obstacle/puzzle. </li>
<li> The section on conditional associations, especially regarding occasion setters, was pretty confusing. I think I would benefit from a reading a short write up of a study or two that looks into these so that I have the real world example of whatever paradigm they use as reference.</li>
<li> "When shock was presented frequently in the absence of the CS, the opportunity would arise for the growth of a strong context-US association that would then block conditioning with the CS." I guess this could be interpreted as an internal monologue of "Oh I just always get shocked when I'm over here, that extra tone doesn't really mean anything" ? </li>
<li> That actually makes a lot of sense, that of course the context would be another stimulus! That's kind of what I was saying earlier, or trying to!</li>
<li> "contexts thus appear to have much in common with occasion setters." Okay I definitely need to read a paper or two on occasion setters because I feel like "occasion setter" is just another way of saying context! Maybe there's a certain intentionality behind occasion setter that is important?</li>
<li> "In the end, although the Rescorla-Wagner model was correct in pointing toward the role of contextual cues in many learning paradigms, it is unlikely that contexts work solely through simple associations with the US. Like parallel research on occasion setting, research on contextual control suggests that a more complex associative structure may often be acquired in associative learning." I just like these for reference, the "gist" of sections!</li>
<li> "They might calculate a value, Deltap, which is the estimated probability of the outcome given the cause, minus the estimated probability of the outcome in the absence of the cause" These sorts of theories about how the human mind works are always so interesting to me. Do they assume we are doing mental math? Consciously or sort of more like... peri-consciously? (is that a word?) I certainly can't do mental math in cases beyond simple addition and subtraction personally! Differences are simple subtraction but determining these probabilities are not, for sure. </li>
<li> "Participants may be first told that a meal of two different foods, AB, is followed by an allergic reaction. Subsequently being told that B alone produces the same reaction is then generally found to reduce the degree to which A is seen a cause of the allergic reaction. Such retrospective revaluation of A is hard to explain with many associative theories (e.g. Rescorla & Wagner 1972), but it is easy to explain by contingency-based theories of causal judgment because they do not take account of the order in which trials are presented." I feel like learning a fact kind of supercedes any sort of associative learning though, because if you know something to be true then even if it seems like there's an association you'll know to look more carefully for other explanations. (Correlation vs. causation, in a way?) </li> </ul></p>

<p>Final thoughts: This article was a bit different than I expected in that it didn't simply move chronologically through all studies in this field nor chronologically follow the growth of it, but instead take the time to compare and contrast a few different theories that try to explain some curious finds/inconsistencies with current theories of associative learning. </p>

<h1>Delamater, A. R. (2011). At the interface of learning and cognition: An associative learning perspective. International Journal of Comparative Psychology, 24(4).</h1>

<p>First thoughts: This is Dr. Delamater's paper and also the most recent one so I am imagining that the previous two papers were background context to help us better understand this one. This paper is also a literature review and even more recent which is fun! These three together I definitely feel like are providing a great foundation to learn more about classic conditioning in class.</p>

<p>Thoughts while reading:<ul>
<li>"the CS enters into an association with the sensoryspecific qualities of the US." Like that previous AB study where the color predicted food and not the pattern, so the rats focused on differences in color and learned faster when totally different stimuli were used as long as the color change is what predicted food!</li>
<li> This paper is interesting for the ways that it is able to use neuro papers to support ideas about what the rats were experiencing! Specifically that the rats in Lee and Holland (2007) who had had sucrose water devalued showed greater activation in the posterior region of the necleus accumbens (activation in this region is shown to be related to unpalatable solutions) as well as less appetitive licking, while rats who had not had sucrose devaluation had more appetitive licking and activation in the anterior nucleus accumbens (predictably, activated with paltable solutions), when both were drinking regular water after whatever tone had previously been associated with sucrose water. I hope that was clear, future me.</li>
<li> "Putting these facts together, it appears that the CS might activate a specific image of sucrose that alters the manner in which the rat perceives water." So the water actually tastes sweeter to them? I wonder if prolonged time with it they realize it's not sweet and drink less. Very interesting!</li>
<li> "In other words, the rat seems to perceive water as though it was sucrose in the presence of the sucrose cue following limited training, but after extensive training the rat seems to understand that the water is not sucrose but that sucrose is, nevertheless, expected to occur in the food magazine." That's just really cool.</li>
<li> Sensory and Temporal Expectancies of the US: While it makes sense to me that the "when" of a stimulus is a separate variable/aspect that can be learned independently of the "what" or the "whether" it will happen, this example was a bit confusing as I don't know what "magazine" means in this context, and some of the other abbreviations "Gp" were also unfamiliar to me, so that made it harder to wrap my head around the design because I kept getting stuck on what those details meant and it was harder to visualize/walk my brain through the events.</li>
<li> Sensory and Motivational Representations of the US: this one confused me quite a bit too, but I think once I understand the previous experiment this one will be easy to build upon that!</li>
<li> Overall I do understand this article is explaining how association-based models of learning like classic conditioning can effectively be used to study, explain, and think about more "cognitive" processes. Awesome!</li>
<li> "The result argues against Thorndike’s S-R associative account because that explanation has no way of explaining how reward devaluation could have a selective effect on responding since the reward itself is not encoded into the associative structure assumed to underlie learning." This and the study it's referring to make a lot of sense. Of course if a rat has had a reward devalued (associated with something bad like LiCl) it's going to want to avoid that experience!
<li> "However, rats tested thirsty displayed more lever press responses in the presence of CS2 compared to CS1. This does not make sense from an inferential reasoning perspective because a signal for liquid sucrose is being shown to elevate responding, ostensibly, for dry pellets while the rats are thirsty." I might need more information but I don't think I agree that this necessarily means the rats are behaving irrationally. Even if they were trained to associate lever presses with pellets, wasn't that always with CS1 present as well? If so, perhaps after experiencing CS2, they are expecting or hoping for the lever press to result in liquid sucrose instead. Is it possible that the rats can see the lever press not necessarily as "brings pellets" but as "brings SOMETHING" and that something is determined by CS1 or CS2. Essentially, can they generalize their expectation for the lever press to include all possible rewards, particularly given that lever presses are now being coupled with different CS that are associated with different rewards?</li>
<li> "However, caution should be applied here because by assuming such degraded propositional encodings, this sort of analysis will run into trouble with other quite basic effects, such as reward-specific Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer effects. Nevertheless, the main point is that an inferential reasoning approach that assumes rational decision-making will have difficulty explaining the two phenomena I have described above without making additional assumptions." My exact idea from above! This does kind of make sense, except that I think that whether or not the rat is able to generalize lever press to include any good reward is an assumption no matter which way you decide. </li>
<li> "There is much current work directed at understanding the nature of reward representations in Pavlovian learning and some of this work is revealing (1) how “images” and “expectancies” may differ in their control of behavior, (2) how the representation of “what” US to expect and “when” it might appear may involve different learning systems, and (3) that learning “what” US to expect and about its motivational value also seems to involve separate systems. These distinct forms of US representation (image, expectancy, temporal, motivational) reflect just four aspects of the complex events we refer to as USs." This sentence just seemed like a really concise way of describing what this article talks about so I am saving it for reference. </li></ul></p>

<p>Final thoughts: Overall I enjoyed this paper for running through several experiments and explaining their findings and how they fit into a few different potential models of how associations are formed and work. There are a few things (like the assumption above about rats' ability to generalize the outcome of a certain stimulus) that I'm interested in hearing more about the argument for/against. There were also some things I was pretty confused about and am hoping that discussing them in class will make them much clearer.</p>
